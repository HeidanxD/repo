Letra Best of me AÃ±adido desde Visual Studio Code

I have a dream
That's all I need
I'll make it happen with some work and belief
Know what I want
So I'll take it on
I've made mistakes but mistakes make you strong
Let's break it down for a minute
I want the crown, I'ma gonna get it
You hear me loud man I'm winning
Yea Charley Sheen would be grinning
These ladies know that I'm sinning
And this is just the beginning
I'm closing in the 9th inning
There ain't no point in resisting

Growing up in Cali Yeahh
You know I love the weather
Lime light hit 'em and you know I handle pressure
I do what I want so I'm never saying never
I get what I want so they call me go getter
Yeahh, I know he does it good
But you know I do it better
So misunderstood
If she want it then I let her
Everybody knows
If I want her then I get her
She gave me that look
Yeah she know she thinks I'm clever
I don't think I do it good
No I think I do it great
They would do it if they could
They can't do it so they hate
Everybody wanna look
But nobody wanna play
Stealing eyes like a crook
While I put it on display
I don't do it by the book
No I do my own thing
That's why every single hook
Got 'em singing like me
And I ain't in any rush
'Cause I'm finally getting paid
Don't believe in any luck
I believe I'm self made, yeah
